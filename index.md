### Social Engineering Awareness Campaign
Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to divulge sensitive information so it can be used to perform some malicious action. Despite security policies, attackers can compromise an organization’s sensitive information by using social engineering, which targets people’s weaknesses.

**Phishing** is a technique in which an attacker sends an email or provides a link falsely claiming to be from a legitimate site to acquire a user’s personal or account information. The attacker registers a fake domain name, builds a lookalike website, and then mails the fake website’s link to users. When a user clicks on the email link, it redirects them to the fake web page, where they are lured into sharing sensitive details, such as their username and password.
