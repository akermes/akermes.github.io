Where is the best place to host a portfolio?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The best place to host a portfolio depends on your specific needs, budget, and how you want to present your work. Here are some popular options that are well-suited for instructional designers and content writers:

1. Wix
Pros: Highly customizable, user-friendly, and offers many templates specifically designed for portfolios.
Cons: Somewhat limited on the free plan, and the branded ads are visible until you upgrade.
Best For: If you want a clean, polished look and don’t mind a bit of design work.
2. Squarespace
Pros: Beautiful, minimalistic designs; good for showcasing multimedia work. It’s easy to use and has integrated features like blogs and contact forms.
Cons: Monthly subscription is required, with limited free trial.
Best For: Professional portfolios with a focus on visuals, with room for growth (e.g., adding a blog).
3. WordPress (with a Portfolio Theme)
Pros: Highly customizable and scalable; numerous plugins and themes for building portfolios.
Cons: Can be more technical to set up if you want customizations beyond templates.
Best For: If you want flexibility and are comfortable with a bit of a learning curve. WordPress also has options for e-commerce, in case you eventually want to add paid courses or other products.
4. Adobe Portfolio
Pros: Free with an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, integrates well with other Adobe tools, and offers sleek, customizable templates.
Cons: Limited to Adobe’s ecosystem, so customization is somewhat restricted compared to other builders.
Best For: Creative professionals or those already using Adobe tools who want a portfolio that’s simple to set up.
5. Google Sites
Pros: Free, easy to use, and integrates well with Google Drive and other Google tools, which is great for embedding documents, PDFs, and slides.
Cons: Basic designs, less customizable and not as professional-looking as other options.
Best For: If you need a simple, cost-effective solution and want to embed work samples directly from Google Drive.
6. Behance

Cons: Limited customization and less suitable for text-heavy portfolios.
Best For: Visual portfolios and for creatives who want to share their work with a broader audience.
7. LinkedIn (with Featured Section)
Pros: Free and provides great exposure for professional work samples. LinkedIn’s Featured section allows you to upload documents, links, and even multimedia samples.

Best For: Instructional designers who want a professional presence on a networking platform, especially if a standalone portfolio site isn’t a priority.
For an instructional design portfolio, Squarespace, Wix, or Adobe Portfolio are excellent choices for a polished, professional look, while Google Sites or LinkedIn offer straightforward, low-cost options if you’re looking for simplicity and practicality.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For a cybersecurity-focused portfolio, you’ll want a platform that not only showcases your instructional design and writing skills but also conveys your understanding of cybersecurity concepts.

5. Wix or Squarespace with Cybersecurity Branding
Pros: Easy to set up, customizable, and allows for a professional look. You can add sections for projects, instructional samples, and even blog posts on current cybersecurity trends.
Cons: Paid options for premium features, but the professional look is worth it if you want to impress.
Best For: If you want a polished, highly professional look with specific branding toward cybersecurity (with sections for “Cybersecurity Awareness Training,” “Technical Writing,” etc.).
6. Adobe Portfolio with Dark, Tech-Focused Themes
Pros: Free with Adobe Creative Cloud and offers sleek, customizable templates that can be tailored for a cybersecurity theme.
Cons: Limited to the Adobe ecosystem but effective if you need a simple, professional portfolio with a tech focus.
Best For: If you want a quick setup with a visually appealing tech theme, highlighting your multimedia work and instructional writing on cybersecurity.
Additional Tips for Cybersecurity Impressions

How do I create a css folder?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a css folder in your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

Go to Your Repository:

Navigate to your repository’s main page on GitHub.
Create a New Folder:

Click on Add file > Create new file.
In the filename field at the top, type css/style.css. By typing css/ before style.css, GitHub will automatically create a folder named css and place the style.css file inside it.
Add CSS Code:

In the text editor area, paste your CSS code (for example, the style.css content I provided in the previous message).
Scroll down and add a commit message, such as Add custom CSS file.
Click Commit new file to save it to your repository.
Link the CSS to Your Pages:

To apply the CSS styling, add a reference to style.css in the head section of your Markdown files.

If you’re using a custom layout, you can link to it in _layouts/default.html or _config.yml. Here’s an example of how to link the CSS file in HTML:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
Now, your repository will have a css folder with your custom style.css file inside, which will apply styling to your GitHub Pages portfolio. Let me know if you need more details on linking the CSS or further customization!






You said:
Can you walk me through the steps to Applying the CSS to Each Page
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure your style.css file applies consistently to each page in your GitHub Pages portfolio:

Step 1: Create the style.css File
In your repository:
Go to Add file > Create new file.
Name the file as css/style.css (which will create a css folder and place style.css inside it).
Add your CSS code in the editor, then Commit the file.
Step 2: Set Up a Custom Layout (if using Jekyll themes)
GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which makes it easy to create a single layout file that applies your CSS to all pages.

Create a _layouts folder:

Go to Add file > Create new file.
Name it _layouts/default.html (adding _layouts/ in the filename will automatically create the folder).
Edit the default.html Layout:

Paste the following HTML structure inside default.html. This will include a link to your style.css file for every page that uses this layout:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    {{ content }}
  </div>
</body>
</html>
Explanation:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css"> links to the style.css file in your css folder.
{{ content }} loads the content from each Markdown file using this layout.
Assign the Layout to Your Markdown Pages:

Open each of your Markdown files (index.md, projects.md, etc.).

At the top of each file, add the following front matter to assign the layout:

markdown
Copy code
---
layout: default
title: Your Page Title
---
Example for index.md:

markdown
Copy code
---
layout: default
title: Aaron Kermes Portfolio
---

# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio
...
Step 3: Test and View Your Site
Push Your Changes: Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
Go to Your GitHub Pages URL: Visit https://yourusername.github.io to check if the CSS styling is applied across all pages.
Adjust and Tweak CSS: If necessary, edit style.css in the css folder to make styling adjustments, then save and push updates to see them live.
Optional: Using _config.yml for Jekyll Theme Settings (If Needed)
If you prefer not to use the layout file and are using a Jekyll theme:

In the root of your repository, create a _config.yml file.

Add the following to load your CSS:

yml
Copy code
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
markdown: kramdown
This approach creates a consistent look across your portfolio, ensuring the custom CSS file is applied to every page. Let me know if you’d like additional help on any step!






You said:
Where do I create the _layouts/default.html file? In CSS folder or in main?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You should create the _layouts/default.html file in the main directory (root) of your repository, not inside the css folder.

Here’s how to do it:

Go to your repository’s main page on GitHub.
Click Add file > Create new file.
In the filename field, type _layouts/default.html. GitHub will automatically create a _layouts folder in the main directory and place the default.html file inside it.
Paste the HTML code for the layout inside this file.
Commit changes to save it to your repository.
Now, your _layouts folder with default.html should be in the main directory, alongside folders like css, and it will apply the layout (including CSS) to all pages that use this layout.






You said:

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here’s how to set up a _config.yml file in your GitHub Pages repository to configure a Jekyll theme and apply your custom CSS file.

Step 1: Create a _config.yml File in the Main Directory
Go to your repository’s main page on GitHub.
Click on Add file > Create new file.
In the filename field, type _config.yml (make sure it’s exactly _config.yml as this file name is recognized by Jekyll).
Now you’re ready to add the configuration settings.
Step 2: Add Jekyll Theme Settings and Markdown Processor
In the editor, paste the following code into your _config.yml file:

yaml
Copy code
# Set a Jekyll theme
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal

# Specify the markdown processor

theme: jekyll-theme-minimal specifies the Jekyll theme you want to use. You can replace jekyll-theme-minimal with other Jekyll themes, such as jekyll-theme-cayman or jekyll-theme-dinky.
markdown: kramdown tells Jekyll to use the kramdown markdown processor, which is commonly used and compatible with GitHub Pages.
Step 3: Configure Your Custom CSS (If Needed)
If you want to ensure your custom CSS (style.css) is loaded, you can link it directly in each page’s layout file, as we did in the previous step with _layouts/default.html.

Alternatively, if you aren’t using a custom layout, you can apply the CSS directly to all pages by including it in _config.yml like this:

yaml
Copy code
# Jekyll theme and markdown settings
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
markdown: kramdown

# Custom CSS file
sass:
  style: compressed

# Set the base URL if you have a custom domain or subdirectory setup
baseurl: ""
Step 4: Commit and Save
Scroll down to the Commit new file section.
Add a commit message like Add Jekyll theme configuration.
Click Commit new file to save _config.yml to your repository.
Step 5: Check Your GitHub Pages Site
Visit your GitHub Pages URL, which should be in the format https://yourusername.github.io.
Your Jekyll theme should be applied automatically, and if you’ve linked your style.css file properly, you’ll see the custom styling in effect.
This configuration allows you to use a Jekyll theme alongside your custom CSS. Let me know if you’d like more help fine-tuning any part of this setup!

If the Jekyll theme isn’t showing up, there are a few common issues that could be causing it. Here’s a checklist to troubleshoot and ensure your theme is applied correctly.

1. Confirm the _config.yml File
Make sure that your _config.yml file is in the main directory (root) of your repository, not inside any folders.

Double-check the file content to ensure there are no typos. The file should look something like this:

yaml
Copy code
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
markdown: kramdown
Replace jekyll-theme-minimal with another theme name (like jekyll-theme-cayman) to see if that loads.
2. Verify GitHub Pages Settings
Go to your repository’s Settings > Pages.
Under Source, make sure you’ve selected the branch (usually main) and the correct folder (usually /root).
Click Save if you make any changes.
3. Check if the Site is Building Correctly
If there are errors in _config.yml or in other files, GitHub Pages may not be able to build the site.
You can check for build errors by looking at the GitHub Actions tab in your repository. GitHub will usually indicate if there’s an error in building the Pages site.
4. Ensure GitHub Pages is Enabled
In Settings > Pages, confirm that GitHub Pages is enabled and that it’s pointing to the correct branch (typically main or master).
After saving, GitHub Pages will provide a URL where you can view your site. Visit this URL to see if the theme appears.
5. Test with a Different Jekyll Theme
If you’re still not seeing the theme, try changing to a different theme in _config.yml to see if it’s a theme-specific issue:

yaml
Copy code
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
6. Clear Browser Cache or Use Incognito Mode
Sometimes, browsers cache the old version of your site. Try clearing your cache or opening your GitHub Pages site in an incognito window.
7. Wait a Few Minutes
Sometimes, it can take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to fully propagate changes, especially after updating _config.yml.
If these steps don’t resolve the issue, let me know, and we can explore additional troubleshooting steps!






You said:
It is not working
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the Jekyll theme still isn’t appearing, here’s a more thorough troubleshooting process to identify and resolve the issue:

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting
1. Verify the _config.yml File is Correct
Double-check that your _config.yml file contains only the following (and is located in the main directory, not inside any subfolder):

yaml
Copy code
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
markdown: kramdown
2. Try a Clean Commit
Edit _config.yml: Delete any extra content or comments.
Save Changes: Add a commit message like “Clean up config file” and commit.
3. Test with a New Theme
Try a different theme in _config.yml, like this:

yaml
Copy code
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
4. Make Sure GitHub Pages is Set Up Correctly
Go to Settings > Pages in your repository.
Under Source, select the main branch and make sure it’s pointing to the root directory (not /docs or another folder).
Save the settings. You should see a URL for your GitHub Pages site, like https://yourusername.github.io.
5. Force a GitHub Pages Rebuild
To force GitHub Pages to rebuild the site:

Go to any Markdown file, such as index.md.
Make a small edit (e.g., add a space) and commit the change with a message like “Force rebuild.”
Visit the GitHub Pages URL provided in Settings > Pages after a few minutes.
6. Enable GitHub Pages in a New Repository (if all else fails)
If nothing works, try creating a new repository to confirm if it’s a repository-specific issue.

Create a new repository with the name test-portfolio (or something similar).
Follow these steps again with only the _config.yml file and an index.md file to see if the theme appears on the new repository’s GitHub Pages site.
Alternative: Manually Link a CSS Theme (If Jekyll Theme Still Fails)
If Jekyll themes are still not appearing, you can manually add a CSS file to simulate the theme. Let me know if you need the code for this, and I can guide you on setting up a manual theme alternative.

Please let me know if you encounter specific issues or if there’s an error message in the GitHub Actions tab!

Can you help me build a manual CSS theme that will resonate with cyber security hiring managers?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Creating a custom CSS theme that resonates with cybersecurity professionals can make a great impression! Let’s go for a sleek, professional look with a dark theme, clean lines, and subtle color accents. Here’s a step-by-step guide for building a theme that aligns with the cybersecurity aesthetic.

Steps to Create the Theme
1. Create Your CSS File
Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on Add file > Create new file.
Name it css/style.css to place the CSS file in a css folder.
In the editor, paste the following CSS code.
2. CSS Code for a Cybersecurity-Themed Portfolio
css
Copy code
/* Basic reset and typography */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #1a1a2e; /* Dark background for a cybersecurity feel */
  color: #e5e5e5; /* Light gray text for readability */
  line-height: 1.6;
}

/* Container to center content */
.container {
  width: 85%;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 20px;
}

/* Headers */
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: #4db8ff; /* Light blue accent for headers */
  text-transform: uppercase;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #4db8ff;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.8em;
}

h3 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

/* Links */
a {
  color: #4db8ff; /* Light blue accent color for links */
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

a:hover {
  color: #ff4d4d; /* Red accent on hover for emphasis */
}

/* Section styling */
section {
  margin-bottom: 40px;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #22223b; /* Slightly lighter background for sections */
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

/* Button styling */
button {
  background-color: #4db8ff;
  color: #1a1a2e;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-size: 1em;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #ff4d4d;
}

/* Footer styling */
footer {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 0.8em;
  color: #888;
}

/* List styles for projects */
ul {
  list-style-type: square;
  padding-left: 20px;
}

ul li {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

3. Link the CSS File to Your Pages
To apply this CSS styling to all your pages, you need to reference it in your layout file or directly in your Markdown files.

Option 1: Link CSS in _layouts/default.html
If you’re using Jekyll:

Create a _layouts folder in the main directory (if it doesn’t exist).

Add a file named default.html.

Paste the following HTML code into default.html:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        {{ content }}
    </div>
    <footer>
        &copy; 2024 Aaron Kermes | Cybersecurity Portfolio
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
Add the following front matter at the top of each of your Markdown files (e.g., index.md, projects.md):

markdown
Copy code
---
layout: default
title: Your Page Title
---
Option 2: Directly Link CSS in Each Markdown File
If you’re not using a Jekyll layout file, add this HTML snippet at the top of each Markdown file to link the CSS:

html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
4. Preview and Test
Commit all changes and ensure your style.css file is saved in the css folder.
Visit your GitHub Pages site (usually https://yourusername.github.io) to view the design.
If styling isn’t appearing immediately, try clearing your browser cache or viewing in incognito mode.
Summary of the Design Features
Dark Background: Conveys a tech/security aesthetic.
Blue Accent Color: Adds a professional and calming accent for links and headers.
Red Hover Effects: A red hover color adds visual interest and emphasizes interactivity.
Section Boxes: Slightly lighter backgrounds with shadows make sections visually distinct, giving the design depth.
This setup provides a clean, cybersecurity-aligned look that hiring managers will find professional and visually appealing. Let me know if you need any specific adjustments or further guidance!






You said:
Ok, now how do I link all of the pages in the root
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To link all of your pages in the root directory, you can add a navigation menu to your default.html layout file (if you’re using one) or add links directly in each Markdown file.

Here are the steps for both methods:

Option 1: Add a Navigation Menu in default.html (If Using Jekyll Layouts)
If you’re using a Jekyll layout file (_layouts/default.html), follow these steps:

Open your _layouts/default.html file in your repository.

Add a navigation menu just below the opening <body> tag. Here’s an example code snippet:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Navigation Menu -->
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/index.md">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="/about.md">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="/projects.md">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="/contact.md">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

        <!-- Page Content -->
        {{ content }}
    </div>
    <footer>
        &copy; 2024 Aaron Kermes | Cybersecurity Portfolio
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
CSS Styling (Optional):

You can style the navigation menu in your style.css file. Add this code to make the menu look cleaner:

css
Copy code
nav ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 20px 0;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    background-color: #22223b;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

nav ul li {
    margin: 0 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
    color: #4db8ff;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-weight: bold;
    transition: color 0.2s;
}

nav ul li a:hover {
    color: #ff4d4d;
}
This will add a simple navigation bar to the top of each page.

Option 2: Manually Link Pages in Each Markdown File
If you’re not using a Jekyll layout, you can add links to each page at the top or bottom of each Markdown file.

Example for index.md:

markdown
Copy code
# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. Here, you’ll find information about my work, projects, and experience in cybersecurity and instructional design.

## Navigation
- [Home](index.md)
- [About](about.md)
- [Projects](projects.md)
- [Contact](contact.md)
Repeat this navigation section in each Markdown file (about.md, projects.md, contact.md), adjusting the links as needed.

Option 3: Use Relative Links with a Sidebar or Footer
If you want the navigation to appear at the bottom of each page, you could add it to the footer section in default.html:

html
Copy code
<footer>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/index.md">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about.md">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="/projects.md">Projects</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact.md">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <p>&copy; 2024 Aaron Kermes | Cybersecurity Portfolio</p>
</footer>
This would place your navigation in the footer, keeping it available on every page.

Final Testing
Commit all changes in GitHub.
Visit your GitHub Pages URL to see if the navigation is working properly.
Test each link to ensure it correctly navigates to the linked pages.
Let me know if you need further customization or if something isn’t working as expected!






You said:
I am using the custom css instead of jekll. I have a README.md, about.md, contact.md, index.html, index.md, and projects.md files. Do I need an index.html and a index.md file?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you’re using a custom CSS setup rather than Jekyll themes, you only need one main entry file for your homepage—either index.html or index.md, but not both. Here’s how to decide:

Use index.html if you want full control over the HTML structure and need to embed custom HTML elements that Markdown doesn’t support (like embedding videos or iframes directly, for example). This file gives you more flexibility.

Use index.md if you prefer to write in Markdown and only need basic formatting (like headings, links, images, and lists). GitHub Pages automatically converts Markdown files to HTML, making it simpler if you don’t need advanced HTML.

Recommended Steps
Since you’re aiming for a cohesive, professional look, here’s what I recommend:

Delete either index.html or index.md to avoid confusion and ensure only one file serves as the homepage.

If you want a simpler setup, delete index.html and use index.md.
If you need more customization, delete index.md and use index.html.
Add Navigation Links in the Chosen File:

If you keep index.html, add links to your other pages (about.md, projects.md, contact.md) using HTML.
If you keep index.md, add links to other pages using Markdown formatting.
Example Code for Each Option
If Using index.html (with HTML Links)
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Portfolio of Aaron Kermes</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Explore my projects and experience in cybersecurity and instructional design.</p>

        <!-- Navigation Links -->
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="about.md">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="projects.md">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact.md">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

        <!-- Main Content -->
        <section>
            <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
            <p>Discover some of my recent work in cybersecurity awareness and instructional design.</p>
        </section>
    </div>
    <footer>
        &copy; 2024 Aaron Kermes | Cybersecurity Portfolio
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
If Using index.md (with Markdown Links)
markdown
Copy code
# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Explore my projects and experience in cybersecurity and instructional design.

## Navigation
- [Home](index.md)
- [About](about.md)
- [Projects](projects.md)
- [Contact](contact.md)

## Featured Projects
Discover some of my recent work in cybersecurity awareness and instructional design.
Summary
Delete one of the index files (choose index.html for more customization, index.md for simplicity).
Ensure the navigation links match the file type you choose.
Check that your CSS file (style.css) is linked correctly in index.html or automatically applied in GitHub Pages.
Let me know if you need further guidance on either setup!

Since you're using custom CSS and Markdown files without Jekyll, you’ll want to ensure that each Markdown file links to the CSS and serves as a standalone webpage. Here’s how to set it up:

Step 1: Choose index.md as the Homepage
Since you’re not using Jekyll and don’t need HTML for specific elements, you can use index.md as your main homepage. This keeps things simpler and allows GitHub Pages to automatically convert Markdown to HTML.

Step 2: Link the Custom CSS in Each Markdown File
Unfortunately, Markdown doesn’t natively support linking external CSS, so you’ll need a workaround to ensure the CSS styling applies to each page.

Convert Markdown to HTML manually for CSS linking:
Rename each .md file to .html and add the CSS link at the top.
Use the following example as a guide for each file:
For example, in index.md (convert it to index.html):

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Portfolio of Aaron Kermes</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Explore my projects and experience in cybersecurity and instructional design.</p>

        <!-- Navigation Links -->
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

        <!-- Main Content -->
        <section>
            <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
            <p>Discover some of my recent work in cybersecurity awareness and instructional design.</p>
        </section>
    </div>
    <footer>
        &copy; 2024 Aaron Kermes | Cybersecurity Portfolio
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
Repeat similar steps for about.md, projects.md, and contact.md by renaming them to about.html, projects.html, and contact.html and copying the HTML structure above. Then replace the content as needed for each page.

Step 3: Update Links in All Files
Since you’ve converted all .md files to .html, make sure your navigation links point to the correct files:

html
Copy code
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
Step 4: Commit and Test
Commit all changes in your GitHub repository.
Visit your GitHub Pages site (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io) to make sure the pages are displaying correctly with your custom CSS applied.
This approach ensures each page is styled consistently and linked properly, giving your portfolio a cohesive, professional look. Let me know if you need more help!

What is the benefit of using Jekyll
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages offers several benefits, especially if you’re building a portfolio or blog. Here’s how Jekyll can make things easier and more professional-looking for your portfolio:

1. Automatic Conversion of Markdown to HTML
Benefit: Jekyll automatically converts .md files into .html, so you can write in Markdown without manually converting each file. This is especially useful if you prefer the simplicity of Markdown but still want a professional HTML output.
Why It’s Helpful: Saves you time and reduces errors, as you don’t need to create separate HTML files or link CSS manually.
2. Built-In Theming and Layouts
Benefit: Jekyll offers pre-built themes (like Minimal, Cayman, and Dinky) that you can use out-of-the-box or customize to your liking. Jekyll themes typically come with a clean, responsive design and good typography.
Why It’s Helpful: You get a professional look without needing to code the entire layout or style from scratch, which can be especially helpful if you’re not a web designer.
3. Consistent Layouts with Templates
Benefit: Jekyll allows you to create layout templates (e.g., _layouts/default.html), which you can apply to every page. This ensures consistency across your portfolio, as each page will have the same header, footer, and navigation.
Why It’s Helpful: Updating the design or navigation across all pages is easy; you only need to update the layout file instead of each individual page.
4. Automatic Navigation and Menus
Benefit: Many Jekyll themes offer built-in navigation support. If you configure your site’s navigation in the _config.yml file, it will automatically create a menu for you.
Why It’s Helpful: Reduces the manual work of linking pages, especially as you add new pages or update content.
5. Organizing Content with Collections
Benefit: Jekyll’s collections feature allows you to group related content types, such as projects or blog posts, and display them in a structured way.
Why It’s Helpful: Collections make it easy to manage and display sets of content, like portfolio items, project case studies, or blog entries. You can control how each collection appears, without creating separate HTML pages for each item.
6. Blogging Capability
Benefit: Jekyll has built-in support for blogging, so you can easily add a blog to your portfolio if you want to write about topics like cybersecurity, instructional design, or technical insights.
Why It’s Helpful: A blog can showcase your expertise, thought leadership, and recent projects, which can impress hiring managers or clients.
7. Easy Configuration with _config.yml
Benefit: The _config.yml file centralizes site settings, like the theme, title, URL, and navigation options. Jekyll uses this configuration file to build the site.
Why It’s Helpful: Simplifies the setup process, making it easy to customize your site globally without editing each page.
8. Supports Plugins for Added Functionality
Benefit: Jekyll allows you to add plugins (limited on GitHub Pages) to extend functionality, such as adding SEO, image optimization, or additional Markdown features.
Why It’s Helpful: Enhances your site’s capabilities without requiring complex code or separate tools.
9. Seamless Integration with GitHub Pages
Benefit: Jekyll is the default static site generator for GitHub Pages, meaning you can deploy your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages with minimal setup.
Why It’s Helpful: This setup is entirely free, and GitHub handles hosting, which is ideal for building a cost-effective, professional portfolio.
Summary of Jekyll’s Benefits for Your Portfolio
Simplicity and Automation: Reduces manual work in linking, styling, and structuring pages.
Consistency: Templates and layouts keep the site’s design uniform.
Professional Aesthetic: Themes provide a clean, visually appealing look with minimal effort.
Additional Features: Blogging, collections, and configuration options add depth and flexibility to your portfolio.
If you’re open to using Jekyll, it could streamline your portfolio creation while enhancing its professionalism and coherence. Let me know if you’d like guidance on setting up Jekyll!

How do I use Jekyll instead of CSS
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Switching to Jekyll will make it easier to style your site consistently without manually linking CSS for each page. Here’s how to set up Jekyll on GitHub Pages and use Jekyll themes instead of custom CSS.

Step 1: Configure Your GitHub Pages Repository for Jekyll
Go to your GitHub repository’s main page.
Delete your css/style.css file and any custom .html files if they exist (like index.html).
Rename your main files to follow Jekyll’s conventions:
Rename index.md to index.md (you don’t need to change anything if it’s already named this way).
Ensure you have Markdown files for other pages like about.md, projects.md, and contact.md.
Step 2: Add a _config.yml File
Jekyll uses _config.yml for site configuration. Here’s how to create and configure it:

Create a new file named _config.yml in the root directory of your repository.

Add the following configuration to set up your theme and basic site settings:

yaml
Copy code
# Basic site settings
title: "Aaron Kermes Portfolio"
description: "Cybersecurity and Instructional Design Portfolio of Aaron Kermes"
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal # You can choose any theme listed below
markdown: kramdown

# Site navigation links (optional)
nav_links:
  - title: "Home"
    url: "/index.html"
  - title: "About"
    url: "/about.html"
  - title: "Projects"
    url: "/projects.html"
  - title: "Contact"
    url: "/contact.html"
theme: Choose a Jekyll theme that works well for professional portfolios. GitHub Pages supports these themes:
jekyll-theme-minimal
jekyll-theme-cayman
jekyll-theme-dinky
jekyll-theme-slate
jekyll-theme-tactile
jekyll-theme-merlot
nav_links: This section will generate a navigation menu if the theme supports it.
Step 3: Set Up Layout and Content with Jekyll
Jekyll themes come with layouts (like default, page, and post) that automatically style your pages. Here’s how to apply a layout to each page:

Add front matter to each Markdown file (e.g., index.md, about.md, projects.md, contact.md) to specify which layout to use.

For example, in index.md:

markdown
Copy code
---
layout: default
title: "Welcome to My Portfolio"
---

# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Explore my projects and experience in cybersecurity and instructional design.
Repeat this for other files, adjusting the title and content as needed.

Commit and Push all changes to GitHub.

Step 4: Preview Your Site on GitHub Pages
Go to your repository’s Settings > Pages.
Ensure the Source is set to the correct branch (usually main) and root directory.
Save the settings, and GitHub will generate a URL for your site.
Optional: Customize Your Jekyll Theme
If you want to customize the theme further, you can add your own CSS by creating an assets folder and linking it in the _config.yml file. However, most Jekyll themes should provide a professional look without additional styling.

This setup will allow you to leverage Jekyll’s built-in themes and layouts, giving your portfolio a polished, cohesive appearance with minimal setup. Let me know if you need further customization or have questions about specific Jekyll themes!

 I have a README.md, about.md, contact.md, index.md, and projects.md files. Can you create the code for each?

Certainly! Below is the code for each of your Markdown files (README.md, index.md, about.md, projects.md, and contact.md). Each file includes front matter at the top, which tells Jekyll how to format and title each page. This setup assumes you’re using a Jekyll theme with a navigation menu, like jekyll-theme-minimal.
